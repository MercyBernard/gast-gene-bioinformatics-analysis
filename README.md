# Bioinformatics Analysis of with Biopython
This repository provides Python scripts for performing several essential bioinformatics tasks, such as retrieving coding sequences (CDS) from NCBI, 
calculating GC content, generating reverse complements, transcription, translation, simulating mutations, and designing primers using Biopython.

# Requirements
Before starting, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
Biopython (Install using: pip install biopython)
Entrez email registration (for retrieving sequences from NCBI)

# Setting Up Entrez
To use NCBI’s Entrez, you need to provide your email for identification:
from Bio import Entrez

Entrez.email = "email"

# Retrieve Coding Sequence (CDS) from NCBI
You can fetch the coding sequence (CDS) of a gene by accession number using Biopython’s Entrez tool.

# Summary
This repository allows you to easily conduct basic bioinformatics tasks using Biopython. 
You can build on these scripts to analyze other genomic features, simulate additional mutations, or design more advanced primers for PCR.
